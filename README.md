Checkpoint 1 - https://youtu.be/O3OJpnRwuGA

As a one-person team, I have planned out the experiment structure and built the application and scripts necessary to run the VR portion of my experiments. Full structure of my three planned experiment types is given in the methodology portion of my submitted paper thus far. After feedback is given regarding the necessity of the 3DTV portion of my experiment, spoken of in the video and the paper, I will either work on getting that experiment put together (building an equivalent environment to my semi-completed VR environment), or work on making the VR environment look as close to the real-world environment I plan to use as possible, as well as fleshing out my paper. Please let me know on necessary feedback on the requested portions of my experiments!

Requested Specific Feedback - 
1. What distance intervals should I use? Should I use AirLink with my PC instead of the cable to allow for larger distances with the blind-walking estimates?
2. Do I need to work on the 3DTV setup and get that experiment working as well? I think it would interesting to compare it to the VR experiment since the FOV is so much smaller, but not sure if it's necessary given I'm a one-person team.
3. What changes do I need to make to the structure of my experiments? (Again, full structure is laid out in the Methodology section of my paper).
4. What edits / areas of improvement do I need on the paper thus far? Is there anything you'd reccomend fleshing out or staying away from?

Code - I chose to submit the entire Unity project files for the two Unity projects I used in my experiments. They can both be found here in this Google Drive folder - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uLjCv_fl5yZG0rAE60a7TQRass4Q_iYY?usp=sharing. Instructions appear in the code video on downloading and setting up these Unity projects.
